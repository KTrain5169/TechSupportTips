# About

This site was created by KTrain5169 out of frustration of people not asking for technical support in the correct way.

This site is a collection of guides on how to ask for technical support in a way that doesn't annoy anyone.

[This site is open source](https://github.com/KTrain5169/TechSupportTips), and you can contribute to it.
